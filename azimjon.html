            <h1>Our commitment</h1>
            <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. <br> We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at <br> home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, <br> we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and  initiatives, and  <br> invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we  <br>roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

                     <h1>Uncompromising quality</h1>
                     <p>Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest <br> and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to <br> avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a <br> roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly <br> coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
